# Deprecated

This page documents the deprecated functions in the Argtable3 library. These
functions are retained for backward compatibility but are no longer recommended
for use in new applications. Developers are encouraged to use the newer, more
robust alternatives provided by the library.

Deprecation indicates that these functions may be removed in future releases, so
transitioning to the recommended alternatives is advised to ensure long-term
compatibility and maintainability of your code.
