# Introduction

Argtable is an open source ANSI C library that parses GNU-style command-line
options. It simplifies command-line parsing by defining a declarative-style API
that you can use to specify what your command-line syntax looks like. Argtable
will automatically generate consistent error handling logic and textual
descriptions of the command line syntax, which are essential but tedious to
implement for a robust CLI program. For example, to create a CLI program that
looks like:

```shell
$ util.exe --help
Usage: util.exe [-v] [--help] [--version] [--level=<n>] [-o myfile] <file> [<file>]...
Demonstrate command-line parsing in argtable3.

--help                    display this help and exit
--version                 display version information and exit
--level=<n>               foo value
-v, --verbose             verbose output
-o myfile                 output file
<file>                    input files
```

:::{note}

This documentation is for the latest Argtable **v3 series**, which is derived
from Argtable v2 series created by [Stewart
Heitmann](mailto:sheitmann@users.sourceforge.net). **Argtable3 is not
backward-compatible**. Therefore, if you want to use Argtable2 API, you have to
go to the [Argtable2 web site](http://argtable.sourceforge.net/) and get the
source code from its [Sourceforge.net project
page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/argtable/).
:::

You can implement the command-line parsing logic with Argtable in the following code snippet:

```c
#include "argtable3.h"

/* global arg_xxx structs */
struct arg_lit *verb, *help, *version;
struct arg_int *level;
struct arg_file *o, *file;
struct arg_end *end;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* the global arg_xxx structs are initialised within the argtable */
    void *argtable[] = {
        help    = arg_litn(NULL, "help", 0, 1, "display this help and exit"),
        version = arg_litn(NULL, "version", 0, 1, "display version info and exit"),
        level   = arg_intn(NULL, "level", "<n>", 0, 1, "foo value"),
        verb    = arg_litn("v", "verbose", 0, 1, "verbose output"),
        o       = arg_filen("o", NULL, "myfile", 0, 1, "output file"),
        file    = arg_filen(NULL, NULL, "<file>", 1, 100, "input files"),
        end     = arg_end(20),
    };

    int exitcode = 0;
    char progname[] = "util.exe";

    int nerrors;
    nerrors = arg_parse(argc,argv,argtable);

    /* special case: '--help' takes precedence over error reporting */
    if (help->count > 0)
    {
        printf("Usage: %s", progname);
        arg_print_syntax(stdout, argtable, "\n");
        printf("Demonstrate command-line parsing in argtable3.\n\n");
        arg_print_glossary(stdout, argtable, "  %-25s %s\n");
        exitcode = 0;
        goto exit;
    }

    /* If the parser returned any errors then display them and exit */
    if (nerrors > 0)
    {
        /* Display the error details contained in the arg_end struct.*/
        arg_print_errors(stdout, end, progname);
        printf("Try '%s --help' for more information.\n", progname);
        exitcode = 1;
        goto exit;
    }

exit:
    /* deallocate each non-null entry in argtable[] */
    arg_freetable(argtable, sizeof(argtable) / sizeof(argtable[0]));
    return exitcode;
}
```


## Features

Here is a list of reasons why you should include Argtable in your C/C++ toolbox:

- **GNU-style command-line syntax**: Use the standard and cross-platform way to express commands.
- **Declarative API**: Eliminate complex parsing logic by specifying what instead of elaborating how.
- **Built-in error handling**: Generate consistent error handling logic.
- **Built-in help messages**: Generate consistent command-line syntax descriptions.
- **Written in ANSI C**: Easy to create bindings for other languages.
- **Readable source code**: Well-commented source code with 100% branch test coverage.
- **Single-file library**: No tedious build scripts. Just drop a single source file into your projects.
- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies.
- **Cross-platform**: Available on most UNIX-like systems, Windows, and embedded systems.
- **BSD-licensed**: Use the library for any purpose, including in commercial programs.


## What’s Next

If you want to learn how to use Argtable3, you can start from the tutorial. If
you want to learn from examples, you can check a list of sample programs in the
repository. And if you find any issue of the documentation or code, you can
submit an issue to the Github project page.

CLI programs have become more and more important in the cloud computing era. We
hope that Argtable can contribute to the Renaissance of CLI and help to make
both developers’ and users’ life easier.
